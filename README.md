In this project I have demonstrated a simple analysis on how to perform data analysis on Microsoft Excel.
Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and the rest of the part was performed on MS Excel 2010.
Steps involved: Data cleaning, Removing Duplicates, Adding extra columns, Renaming fields names, Pivot Tables, Dashboard.
After the final Dataset was ready the Dashboard shows various Visualizations with the help of different graphs & charts.

This Data Analysis shows a basic beginner data insights/information on Excel which cover almost all the steps, pivot tables & visualization concepts.
