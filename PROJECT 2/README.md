In this project I have demonstrated a simple analysis on how to perform data analysis on Microsoft Excel. Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle by a Member who had already performed the DATA CLEANING AND TRANFORMATION.
Steps Performed by my side: Extra Pivot Tables & Dashboard making.
After the final Dataset was ready the Dashboard shows various Visualizations with the help of different graphs & charts.

This Data Analysis shows a basic beginner data insights/information on Excel which cover almost all the steps, pivot tables & visualization concepts. Screenshots:
